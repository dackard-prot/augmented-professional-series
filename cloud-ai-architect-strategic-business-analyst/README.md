**Status:** 🟡 DRAFT – ON HOLD  
**Track Type:** Full-Stack Cloud & AI Architecture + Strategic Business Analysis  

---

### Overview

This repository documents a comprehensive architectural training track focused on the transformation of legacy and cloud systems into intelligent, scalable, and economically controlled digital platforms.

The program integrates engineering execution with architectural reasoning and strategic business alignment.

It was designed as a full-stack capability path — from infrastructure resilience to AI-enabled system intelligence and executive-level decision support.

---

### Architectural Scope

The track operates across five core architectural layers:

#### 1. Infrastructure & Resilience
Design of secure, scalable, and failure-tolerant cloud environments with measurable availability and recovery characteristics.

#### 2. Data Evolution
Transition from structured relational models to multi-model and semantic data systems capable of supporting intelligent workloads.

#### 3. Applied AI Integration
Embedding predictive models, anomaly detection, explainability, and AI-assisted services into operational systems.

#### 4. Automation & Delivery Discipline
Infrastructure as Code, CI/CD orchestration, security validation, cost control, and reproducible deployment pipelines.

#### 5. Strategic Business Alignment
Translation of technical architecture into business value through ROI modelling, cost governance, and executive reporting.
